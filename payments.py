"""The five tools, as plain functions. The MCP server is a thin shell over this.

Money is an integer count of raw everywhere below (1 XNO = 10**30 raw).
Decimal XNO strings are parsed by `wallet.xno_to_raw` and rendered by
`wallet.raw_to_xno`, both exact. No float touches a balance, an amount or
a comparison in this file. A double holds 53 bits of mantissa and a raw
balance needs up to 128, so a single float round-trip would silently
round away real money.
