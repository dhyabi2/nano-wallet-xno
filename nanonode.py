"""The one place in this package that touches the network.

Everything else - address creation, validation, block construction and
signing - runs offline in the caller's process. That separation is the
point: an operator reviewing this install can read this single file to
see every byte that leaves the machine, and `receive-only` mode adds
nothing to it.

`NanoNode` is an interface, not a class to inherit from for its
behaviour. `HttpNanoNode` speaks the standard Nano node RPC over HTTP;
the test-suite substitutes an in-memory fake. No test in this repository
opens a socket.
